                        deeply-veined dark purple with a yellow-white signal. The petals are very reduced in size, not
                        exceeding the base of the sepals. Beachhead iris flowers in late spring, on a one flowered
                        inflorescence. The leaves are stiff, narrow and green, with a purplish tinged base. The leaves
                        are up to 12 inches high. The leaves arise from shallowly rooted, large, branching rhizomes
                        forming clumps.
                        These are vigorous plants with strong, sword-like foliage about 2 ft. in height. The iris
                        flowers are purple-blue, usually of a very dark shade, but occasionally pale lavender and
                        intermediate shades. Flowers are 3-6 in. wide.</div>

                                plant, growing 10–80 cm (4–31 in) high. It tends to form large clumps from thick,
                                creeping rhizomes. The unwinged, erect stems generally have basal leaves that are more
                                than 1 cm (1⁄2 in) wide. Leaves are folded on the midribs so that they form an
                                overlapping flat fan. The well developed blue flower has 6 petals and sepals spread out
                                nearly flat and have two forms. The longer sepals are hairless and have a
                                greenish-yellow blotch at their base. The inferior ovary is bluntly angled. Flowers are
                                usually light to deep blue (purple and violet are not uncommon) and bloom during May to
                                July. Fruit is a 3-celled, bluntly angled capsule. The large seeds can be observed
                                floating in fall.</div>

                                        has 2 to 4 erect or arching, bright green, lance-shaped leaves that are
                                        flattened into one plane at the base. Leaves are 1–3 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄4 in) wide and
                                        are sometimes longer than the flower stalk. The fleshy roots (1–2 cm or 1⁄2–3⁄4
                                        in in diameter) are rhizomes that spread underground. Pale brown, variably
                                        shaped seeds are born in three-part fruit capsules (3–6 cm or 1+1⁄4–2+1⁄4 in

                                        consist of 3 horizontal sepals, or "falls", and 3 erect petals. The petals and
                                        sepals can vary in color from dark-violet to pinkish-white. The sepals have a
                                        splash of yellow to yellow-orange at the crest. Each plant has 2 to 6 flowers
                                        that bloom from April to May upon a single, erect, 30–90 cm (12–35 in) tall
                                        stalk. The stalk is sometimes branched and has a slight zigzag appearance.
